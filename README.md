# Tic-Tac-Toe Game using React

Welcome to the Tic-Tac-Toe open-source project.

## Introduction

Tic-Tac-Toe is a classic two-player game where players take turns to mark a square in a 3x3 grid with their symbol, typically 'X' or 'O'. The goal is to form a line of three of your symbols horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

This project is an open-source implementation of Tic-Tac-Toe built using React. It provides a simple and interactive way to play the game in your web browser.

## Features

- A user-friendly interface for playing Tic-Tac-Toe.
- Real-time updates to the game board.
- Ability to restart the game with just one click.
- Clear indication of the game's outcome (win, draw, or ongoing).
- Built using React, making it a great example for learning or teaching React concepts.
